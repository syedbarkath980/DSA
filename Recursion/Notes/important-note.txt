Difference between a Loop and Recursion: 
🔁 Loops vs 🔄 Recursion 

Loops repeat using for or while and are memory-efficient.

Recursion repeats by calling the function itself and uses more memory (stack).

Loops are better for simple, repetitive tasks.

Recursion is useful when solving problems that can be broken into smaller versions of themselves (like trees, factorial, Fibonacci).

Loops stop when a condition fails; recursion stops at a base case.
